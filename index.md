# Timothy C. Yu

I am a PhD student advised by Jesse Bloom at Fred Hutch. My work is supported by a NSF graduate research fellowship.

My current interest is in the evolutionary dynamics of human influenza viruses. I am exploring how these viruses cleverly acquire mutations to elude our immune systems through a blend of experiment, computation, and theory.
